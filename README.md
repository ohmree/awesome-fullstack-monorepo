# Fullstack monorepo template

Generate a repo from this template, edit `copier.yml` to your liking and wait for GitHub to generate your repo.

## Things that don't work at the moment

 - Can't use esm-only dependencies on the backend (e.g. [milliparsec](https://github.com/tinyhttp/milliparsec))
 - HMR doesn't work when running `pnpm dev:server`
